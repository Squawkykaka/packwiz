# Minecraft Modpack Project

Welcome to our Minecraft Modpack Project. This project utilizes the 
[packwiz](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz) modpack management tool 
to deliver an enhanced Minecraft gameplay experience with a variety of 
mods.

## About packwiz

[Packwiz](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz) is a robust tool for 
managing Minecraft modpacks. It allows modpack creators to define their 
modpacks using TOML files, which can include detailed information about
 mods, overrides, and pack settings. One of the key features of packwiz 
 is its support for versioning, enabling users to update their modpacks 
 seamlessly as new versions are released.

## Featured Mods

Our modpack includes a diverse range of mods. The modpack features 
popular mods such as Biomes O' Plenty, Create, and many more. You can see them all over at our [modlist](https://github.com/Squawkykaka/packwiz/blob/master/modlist.md)
